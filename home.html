            <p>
              COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has made it extremely difficult for
              a lot of people to have access to essential medical services.
              India has been under a strict nationwide lockdown since March 22
              that stopped all forms of public transportations. This created a
              severe health care insecurity for the people who lack a reliable
              medical facility in their region. Furthermore, people’s fear of
              contracting COVID-19 in hospitals discouraged them from making a
              visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              A transition to telemedicine can not only help people access
              healthcare services more easily and safely, but also can prevent
              hospitals from crowding so that the people who need to be seen in
              person can be treated in a safer, and less crowded environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              OrangeHealth is a startup that aims to solve healthcare insecurity
              in India by providing an online platform that connects doctors and
              patients for online health consulting, prescription, billing and
              so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, we sought to build a comprehensive health care
              interface for patients that would include the functionality to
              register for and attend appointments, view health records, and
              otherwise contact the health care team. This same interface would
              have a similarly designed but intentionally distinct version for
              doctors, such that doctors can log in to view and attend their
              upcoming appointments, maintain their patient lists and health
              records, and manage a working calendar.

                the OrangeHealth app, is. Log in as a patient, check when the

                User A analyzed the two homepages for the doctor and patient
                very well, but he neglected the use of the bottom navbar. User
                A’s comment about the homepages being very simple, straight to
                the point, and friendly for elderly users was expected. We
                designed the app to be user friendly to an audience of all ages.

                User B gave a very detailed and thorough review of the
                interface. Similar to User A, he commented that for a medicine
                related smartphone application, the application must be simple
                and understandable so that it can accommodate a wider audience.
                Our prototype was very user friendly and easy to understand. He
                commented that the navigation bar on the bottom may be
                confusing, but as a fully developed smartphone app, users would
                figure out what each button did in no time. It was also great to
                see that User B could identify exactly the functionalities of
                each homepage (patient and doctor) by simply glancing at it.

                User C was relatively quick in navigating to the messages and
                patient portal, which we believe was a good sign that the icons
                and the nav bar were pretty clear in what it was trying to do.
                He seemed a bit confused when he was doing the task of adding a
                new appointment to the calendar. (He kept going back and forth)
                User C commented that he particularly liked the “message”
                section and thought the usability of this app was pretty
                straightforward and clear. He also said that he liked how he
                didn’t have to leave the app to make an appointment, communicate
                with your practitioner, and even have a meeting with them.
                Lastly, he recommended making it a bit more aesthetically
                pleasing,but besides that he didn’t think our mockup needed much
                improvement.
